# Function- a function is a set of code instructiond
# for a computer to follow.



# phase 1: dunction definition
we are describing the instruction
def examole ()




# phase 2: function call/invation
3 # where we are ready to use a function,
# we write ito use it.
# functions- is a set of code instruction labeld under
# a custom name that the computer will run
# Functions Hsve 2 phases: functions definitions and 
# fucntion call

# phase 1: functions definition 
# we are desribing the insdtructions for our custom code
# we are adding logic to the computers vocabulary
# this code does not run -

# phase 2 functon call 
# once we have the difinition, we can now run the instructions 
# by writing the function name.

example ()
# we ident to infrom the computer that we are about to right
# code instructions. if we dont, we will get an error
